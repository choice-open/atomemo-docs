# Acceptable Use Policy

**Effective Date**: January 1, 2025

## 1. Introduction

We developed {{PRODUCT_NAME}} to revolutionize workflow automation and customer experience management (CEM). With {{PRODUCT_NAME}}, we have created a powerful platform that empowers organizations to build intelligent automation solutions through visual workflow builders, advanced AI agents, and seamless integrations. Our platform uniquely combines workflow automation with AI-powered agents to deliver exceptional customer experiences, automate complex business processes, and enable organizations to create intelligent, conversational applications at scale.

At the heart of {{PRODUCT_NAME}} are our AI agents—sophisticated, context-aware assistants that can understand natural language, access knowledge bases, execute workflows, and interact with customers in meaningful ways. These agents, combined with our visual workflow editor, plugins ecosystem, and enterprise-grade infrastructure, enable organizations to transform how they engage with customers and automate their operations.

Our conviction has always been that by providing powerful automation tools and intelligent AI agents, we can help millions of users and organizations deliver better customer experiences while working more efficiently. This conviction motivates us to make {{PRODUCT_NAME}} accessible through both our free Community Edition and our Enterprise Edition, and it fuels our ongoing commitment to ensuring our users derive maximum value from our platform.

Our approach has proven successful: {{PRODUCT_NAME}} is now serving organizations of all sizes across industries—from customer support and sales automation to employee experience management and intelligent chatbots. We continuously receive feedback that we are helping them automate critical processes, enhance customer interactions through AI agents, and deliver personalized experiences that delight their users. This not only benefits our customers but also positively impacts their end users and the broader community.

However, we recognize that powerful automation tools can be misused. Given the flexibility of {{PRODUCT_NAME}}, the variety of integrations it supports, and the capabilities of AI agents, it's essential to establish clear guidelines about acceptable use. While we believe the vast majority of our users have good intentions, our platform must not be used in ways that harm others, violate laws, or contradict our core values.

The intent of this Policy is to make it clear to anyone who uses {{PRODUCT_NAME}} (whether Community Edition or Enterprise Edition, self-hosted or cloud-hosted) what behavior and content are not acceptable. We will take action against users and deployments that are discovered to be in violation of this Policy.
